# Wagtailitalia - a framework for the deployment of a Wagtail CMS project

This framework answers to the need of a one-click deployment of a fully functional CMS, which can be completely customizable from the user dashboard.

It intends to promote competition in the CMS industry, reduce the costs for public administrations and the overpriced and often outdated products which the private sector offers to unexperienced public servants.

It is based on Wagtail an open-source solution based on the versatile Django framework, which was chosen for prototyping speed and security features.
